# Paint App in C#

I created a simple **Paint App** using C# that allows users to:

- **Draw** in various colors
- **Erase** drawings
- **Save** the drawing to a file
- **Open** previously saved drawings

## Features

### 1. **Drawing in Various Colors**
   The app provides a color palette, enabling users to choose different colors to draw.

### 2. **Erase Function**
   Users can switch to an eraser tool to remove any part of the drawing.

### 3. **Save the Drawing**
   Drawings can be saved as image files in formats such as PNG, JPEG, etc.

### 4. **Open Previous Drawings**
   Saved image files can be opened and edited again within the app.

### Tech Used
- **C#** for application logic
- **Windows Forms** for UI components

### How It Works

1. **Drawing**: The user can click and drag to draw on the canvas. The tool will use the selected color to paint on the canvas.
   
2. **Erasing**: By selecting the eraser tool, the user can remove parts of their drawing by dragging the cursor over the areas they wish to erase.

3. **Saving**: Once satisfied with the drawing, the user can click the "Save" button to store the image in their desired location.

4. **Opening**: The "Open" button allows users to select and open an existing drawing file to continue editing.
